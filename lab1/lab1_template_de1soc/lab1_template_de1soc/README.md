Lab 1
===
## Task 1
design a frequency divider, and use sw to control different outputs

## Task 2
Use sw[0] to turn on and off the audio

## Task 3
Control the "LCD"'s display and the signal

## Task 4
Change the context for information console

## Task 5
Change the LED every 1 second.

# Demonstration
> (a) your frequency divider;

> (b) the tone organ - including the part that selects and emits the
frequencies (but you are not required to show simulations for the code
that handles the display of the frequencies on the LCD, and not
including any simulations for the audio chip code).

> (c) The circuit that makes the LEDs light up from side to side
